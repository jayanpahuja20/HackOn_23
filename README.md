# Introduction
***
* Welcome to the Goal-based Product Recommender and Checklist Provider via GenAI! 
* Meet SmartShop Alexa, your intuitive virtual shopping guide for Amazon's vast digital marketplace. 
* While the abundance of Amazon's offerings presents users with vast choices and planning challenges, especially for specific situations like events or vacations, the current system often lacks a context-aware guide. This gap can lead to missed opportunities both for customers and Amazon's full sales potential. 
* Enter our solution: an intelligent conversational AI, rooted in Large Language Models (LLM), that understands user intent, providing a personalized and interactive shopping journey. With SmartShop Alexa, users receive tailored product and service recommendations, ensuring a richer shopping experience. 
* This dedicated and individualized service is nothing but our "Customer Obsession" centred approach. In an online world that can sometimes feel lonely, SmartShop Alexa is here to be your trusted companion, always ready to help you achieve your goals with utmost satisfaction.
